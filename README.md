* **/gaydar \[player]**: Get a random “gay%” reading for yourself or another player, complete with an ultra-rare
  “bugged” result.
* **/transdar \[player]**: Get a random “trans%” reading for yourself or another player, complete with an ultra-rare
  “bugged” result.
* **/gender <identity>**: Display a definition and a text‑based pride‑flag preview for various gender identities (e.g.
  transgender, nonbinary, agender, etc.).
* **/sexuality <orientation>**: Display a definition and a text‑based pride‑flag preview for various sexualities (e.g.
  gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, etc.).
* **/list \<genders|sexualities|all>**: List all supported gender identities, sexualities, or both at once—each wrapped
